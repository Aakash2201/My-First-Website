         here we have used inline css to change background color of our website in order to do that we have to use style =""
         and inside style we have to select property of css which we have to select here we have to select background color
         note : here we have to change background color of entire website so thats why we have used background color tag in
                body of our website -->

               which you are looking for and you can directly press right click on that image and COPY THE IMAGE ADDRESS
               from google and you can directly paste it on the src of img tag -->

               here istead of google we are using image on our own device this way of accessing image from our device memory
               is more safe than accessing images from google.
               To crop images in circle we can use website named = "https://crop-circle.imageonline.co/"

    <!-- there are two tags which can make our paragraph text itallic first one is "<i></i>" and the second one is
          "<em></em>". Here the "i" tag only itallicis out text while the "em" tag also emphesices our text so it is
          always better to use "em" tag over "i" tag -->

    <!-- similarly there are two tags to make our text bold first one is "<b></b>" while the other one is
          "<strong></strong>". Here also we have to use strong tag over bold as it tells compiler that the text
          has strong meaning -->

    <table cellspacing = "10px">

      <!-- cellspacing basically helps as to add distance between two data elements in our table.-->



      <tr>
        <td><img src="image/DY PATIL RAIT.png" height="70px"></td>

        <td><h4>Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology</h4></td>

        <td><h4>Bachelor of Engineering - BE (2019 - 2023)</h4></td>
      </tr>

        <td><h4>C.S.S High School - Mumbai</h4></td>

        <td><h4>SSC (2007 - 2017)</h4></td>
      </tr>

    </table>

    <!-- In order to arrange data in systematic manner we can use "<table> </table>" tag. we can represent
        tables in two different ways the abouve notation is simple notation where we have added elements directly
        without any structure using "<tr></tr>" and "<td></td>" tag (table row and table data tag).
        The second and most efficent way is to form a structure of table using :

        <table>
          <thead>
            <td>{whrite headings of your table hear}</td>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <td>{write main content of your table here}</td>
          </tbody>
          <tfoot>
            <td>{end your table Here}</td>
          </tfoot>
        </table>

        this syntax provides us easy handaling as well as designing of a particular elemnt of the table.
        Note:- here <td></td> tag is common in both the arrangments of table cause this tag is used to define
               elements of our table.
